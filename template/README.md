This is a work in progress snippet

This is a template file and folder for how to document a new data source that is compatible with the Prifina ecosystem. 

This data source repo should include: 
- source data model (GraphQl schema)
- the data model in spreadsheet format (Google link or uploaded spreadsheet file)
- function to retrieve the data (e.g. API queries or file upload)
- any scripts needed to format the data while retaining 100% data integrity
- a readme with an index and outline of the repo contents.
